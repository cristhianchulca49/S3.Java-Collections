## 🧩 Level 1 Exercises (S1.03)

### Exercise 1: Month Collection
- Create a class named `Month` with an attribute `name` (representing the name of the month).  
- Add 11 `Month` objects (each with a different name) to an `ArrayList`, leaving out `"August"`.  
- Insert `"August"` at its correct position to maintain chronological order.  
- Convert the `ArrayList` into a `HashSet` and ensure no duplicates are allowed.  
- Iterate over the list using both a **for loop** and an **Iterator**.  

### Exercise 2: List Reversal
- Create and populate a `List<Integer>`.  
- Create a second `List<Integer>` and insert the elements of the first list in **reverse order**.  
- Use **ListIterator** to traverse the first list and insert elements into the second list in reverse.  

### Exercise 3: Country-Capital Quiz
- Read the file `countries.txt` containing countries and their capitals.  
- Store the data in a `HashMap<String, String>`.  
- Prompt the user for their name, then ask them for the capitals of 10 randomly selected countries.  
- For each correct answer, award 1 point.  
- Save the user's name and final score to a file called `classification.txt`.
